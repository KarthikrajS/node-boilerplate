Optional Improvements:
User Profile Update: You can create an endpoint that allows users to update their profile (e.g., change email, password, etc.).
Email Validation: Implement email validation to ensure that the user’s email is in a proper format during registration.
Password Reset: Implement a password reset feature where users can reset their password if they forget it.

Role Management (if required): To extend this boilerplate into more complex apps with different user roles.
Database Seeding: You might want to have some seed data for testing purposes or initial setup.
API Rate Limiting: In case you need to handle heavy traffic, consider adding rate limiting (using something like express-rate-limit).
Logging and Monitoring: Integrating logging and monitoring (Winston, Morgan, or similar) will help you track the health of your app.
Testing: For now, it’s good to have basic functionality, but adding unit tests for key functionality will be essential for maintainability in the future.
